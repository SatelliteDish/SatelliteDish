## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:
My name is Michael and I'm a 21 year old developer from Vancouver! I'm self taught, but work hard to try and keep a well rounded knowledge base. Notice any issues in my code? Don't hesitate to call me out or open a PR, I'm always looking for ways to improve. Want to collaborate on something or just want to reach me in general? You can do so at any of my socials.

## Current Projects
Some of the things on here are unfinished projects and/or some very early projects. I like to keep them here to show progress, but I am well aware some of the code here is very rough, most of it is from when I just started learning the language. I'll do my best to keep this list updated

-[Currently untitled game](https://github.com/SatelliteDish/JamGame): This was a submission for CBJam 2023 that didn't get finished in time due to life issues. This is a group project that we're making in Godot. Now that the time limit is off, I plan on going back and refactoring.
-[Cat Attack!](https://github.com/SatelliteDish/CatAttack-): This was is my first solo Unity game. A lot of stuff here is rough as I haven't refactored some scripts since I originally wrote them nearly 2 years ago. Some of the art and animations are also needing a redo, I learned pixel art and animation for this game so literally my first sprites and animations are in use.
-[DnD Companion App](https://github.com/SatelliteDish/DnD-Companion-App): A companion app for game masters of all TTRPGs. I'm a DM for DnD 5e so this app will contain all the features that I really want and use, I hope others will also find it useful. This is my first project using Ionic or Vue, so some of the stuff is probably in need of refactoring. I plan on switching from the Options API to the Composition API soon, and I'm excited for how that will turn out.
